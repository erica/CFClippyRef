# CFClippyRef

The Clippy package consists of a core tile image (clippymap.png) and JSON (animjson.txt) that describes how the animation sequences are built from individual tiles. These resources are straight from the [Clippy.JS](http://www.smore.com/clippy-js) project, by the smore group.

Their project was released under an MIT license. They take care to note *All Microsoft agents, including agent names, the Clippy brand and all resources are the property of Microsoft and their respective owners.*.

My extensions are released under my standard BSD license:

My extensions include a tile helper class (`TileHelper`) that extracts individual tiles from a combined PNG and a shared Clippy helper (`ClippyHelper`) which retrieves sequenced animation frames and can build `UIImage` animations for you.

**Create a helper**

```objc
+ (id) helper;
```

**Create a properly-sized Clippy-ready image view** 

```objc
- (UIImageView *) baseImageView;
```

**List all animations available**

```objc
- (NSArray *) animationNames;
```
 
*Be aware that I only roughly implement the animations, and there's lots of work to be done adding proper sequencing and branching.*

**Retrieve a fully populated `UIImageView` with a named animation**

```objc
- (UIImageView *) animationNamed: (NSString *) aName repeats: (BOOL) yorn;
```

**Retrieve an array of animation frames for a named animation**

```objc
- (NSArray *) animationSequenceNamed: (NSString *) aName;
```

**Replace an image view's animation with the named animation sequence**

```objc
- (void) addAnimation: (NSString *) aName to: (UIImageView *) aView repeats: (BOOL) yorn;
```
